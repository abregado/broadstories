About:
______________
The Broadstories Prototype was designed by Binary Gambit to test the planned core mechanic of the upcoming game Fables of Fabularia.

The mechanic under scrutiny is the chess-like combination attack system. To demonstrate this, Binary Gambit stripped out most of the other planned features in order to focus on the combo mechanic.

You can find out more about Fables of Fabularia at http://www.broadstories.com and you can discover more about the prototyping process at http://prototype.binarygambit.com
